X-ray Image Enchancement Tool: 
User Interaction: Selecting a specific area on the image with the mouse and performing operations on this area.
This code creates a PySide6 based graphical user interface (GUI) application and combines image processing operations with user interaction.
The application provides basic features such as loading an image file, adjusting contrast, enlarging or reducing the image, and performing operations on a selected area.
The user can select a region on the image with the mouse, zoom in on this region, or perform edge detection and draw broken contours in blue. 
The Canny algorithm is used for edge detection, and contours larger than a certain size are considered broken. 
All operations can be easily controlled with scroll bars and mouse movements, and the results are dynamically displayed on the screen. 
This application provides both image manipulation and user-friendly interaction.
